# License and Code Privacy

We have included some options for participants who do not want their code and/or software licenses leaked or uploaded to a public repository. 

## Code Privacy
In order for the [app.samplchallenges.org](https://app.samplchallenges.org/) to have access to your containers upon submission, you containers must be uploaded to your container repository (ghcr.io, docker.io, etc.) and marked as public or uploaded to our private container repository on Amazon Web Services. Our private container repository is a push only repository. Participants may only push NOT pull from it, making it so only app.samplchallenges.org website administrators from the Mobley Lab have access to your code.
